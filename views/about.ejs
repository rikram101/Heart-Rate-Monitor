      Team Core Beat presents an IoT-based Heart Rate Monitoring System designed
      to track real-time heart rate and blood oxygen saturation levels using the
      MAX30102 sensor. The device communicates data securely to a Node.js and
      MongoDB backend, where users can visualize their health trends through an
      interactive web interface. Our goal is to make continuous health
      monitoring accessible and insightful for everyone.
